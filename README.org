* Toma-what?

  Some time ago I wrote [[https://github.com/konr/tomatinho][Tomatinho]], a [[http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/][pomodoro technique]] timer that
  addresses the stressful and cheating-prone workflow of previous
  timers. This will be the mobile version of it, written in 
  ClojureScript.
